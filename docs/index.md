# Trusted Application Pipeline Software Template

This application, **codegen-sep26-2v**, was created from a Trusted Application Pipeline Software Template.

The software templates create a new source and gitops deployment repositories with a sample source application. 

## Repositories

The source code for your application can be found in [https://github.com/redhat-appstudio-mjf/codegen-sep26-2v ](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio-mjf/codegen-sep26-2v ).
 
The gitops repository, which contains the kubernetes manifests for the application can be found in 
[https://github.com/redhat-appstudio-mjf/codegen-sep26-2v-gitops ](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio-mjf/codegen-sep26-2v-gitops ) 

## Application namespaces
